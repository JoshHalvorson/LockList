### Why
I wanted to tackle the issue and YouTube not being super safe as a platform for children. Videos can autoplay that aren't related to what was originally played and can lead to a child seeing something you might not want them to. With my app, you can log in to your Google account, select a playlist that you have created on YouTube, and have those videos, and those videos only, autoplay through the playlist.

### Building
Put your own api key in `local.properties`: API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
